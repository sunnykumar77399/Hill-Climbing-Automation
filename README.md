# 🏎️ Hill Climbing Automation using OpenCV and Python

This project automates the **Hill Climb Racing** game using **OpenCV** and **Python** by analyzing the game screen in real-time and simulating key presses based on visual cues.  
It demonstrates the use of **computer vision techniques** for automation and intelligent decision-making.

## 🚀 Features

- Detects road, vehicle, and obstacles in real time using **OpenCV**.  
- Automatically controls acceleration and braking.  
- Efficient decision-making using **image processing** and **logical automation**.  
- Supports easy modification and tuning for different terrains.  
- Can be integrated with machine learning for future improvements.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Screen Capture:**  
   Captures the game window continuously using OpenCV.

2. **Region of Interest (ROI):**  
   Defines specific areas (like vehicle position and road) for processing.

3. **Color Detection & Thresholding:**  
   Filters out unwanted regions and identifies key areas like obstacles.

4. **Decision Logic:**  
   Based on pixel values or contours, the system decides whether to accelerate or stop.

5. **Keyboard Automation:**  
   Uses Python’s `pyautogui` or `keyboard` module to simulate key presses.
